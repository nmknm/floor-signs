## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Specifications

*   **Resolution:** `1920x1920` pixels
*   **File Format:** `PNG`.
*   **Included Signs:**
    *   **Numbers:** -9 through 99.
    *   **Letters:** L (Lobby), P (Parking).
*   **Font Sizing Logic:**
    To ensure visual consistency, the font size is adjusted based on the width of the character(s). Wider characters (like `99` or `50`) use a slightly smaller font size than narrow characters (like `1` or `11`) to appear perfectly centered and balanced within the frame.
    *   **Narrow Characters** (e.g., `1`, `7`, `L`, `P`): 2800px
    *   **Wide Characters** (e.g., `-9`, `41`): 2400px
    *   **Extra-Wide Characters** (e.g., `99`, `50`): 2000px
